# Energy calculation for Pions (REYES 2024)
This repository contains the code used for analysing the $2$-point functions for pions as part of the [REYES](https://physics.berkeley.edu/visiting-students/reyes-remote-experience-young-engineers-and-scientists) 2024 program. The code implements the jackknife binning and error analysis to extract energy from the $2$-point functions of pions using plateau fitting.

The project was carried out under the supervision of [Dr. Martha Constatinou](https://phys.cst.temple.edu/martha-constantinou.html).
